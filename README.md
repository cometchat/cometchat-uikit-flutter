# CometChat Flutter UI Kit

CometChat Flutter UIKit provides pre-built user interface kit that developers can use to quickly integrate a reliable & fully featured chat experience into an existing or a new mobile app.<br />

### Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.0.5
- Dart 2.17.6
- Android Studio 2021.3 dolphin
- Xcode 14.2
- Android 9, API 28 and above
- iOS 11.0 

## Getting Started
To set up Flutter Chat UIKit and utilize CometChat for your chat functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Create an Account**: Register at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) to create an account.

2. **Create an Application**: After registering, log into your CometChat account and create a new app. Once created, CometChat will generate an Auth Key and App ID for you. Keep these credentials secure as you'll need them later.
